# Net-Energy-Output-Forecasting
The training dataset contains 8500 data points collected from a power station over several years. You should build a model to forecast the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the power station.

The recorded attributes in the dataset include the following hourly average variables:

* Temperature (AT)
* Ambient Pressure (AP)
* Relative Humidity (RH)
* Exhaust Vacuum (V)

This power station has gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. Here, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three of the ambient variables affect the GT performance.
